 Circular Queue

Previously, we have provided a straightforward but inefficient 
implementation of queue.

A more efficient way is to use a circular queue. Specifically, 
we may use a fixed-size array and two pointers to indicate the 
starting position and the ending position. And the goal is to 
reuse the wasted storage we mentioned previously.

Let's take a look at an example to see how a circular queue works. 
You should pay attention to the strategy we use to enqueue or dequeue 
an element.

Review the animation carefully to figure out the strategy we use to 
check if a queue is empty or full.

For the next exercise, we will let you try to implement the circular 
queue by yourself and provide a solution later.
