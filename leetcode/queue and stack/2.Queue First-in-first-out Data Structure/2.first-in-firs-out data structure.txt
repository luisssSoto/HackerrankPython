First-in-first-out Data Structure

In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will 
be processed first.

As shown in the picture above, the queue is a typical FIFO data 
stucture. The insert operation is also called enqueue and the new 
element is always added at the end of the queue. The delete operation 
is called dequeue. You are only allowed to remove the first element.
