Introduction

We may access a random element by index in Array. However, we might 
want to restrict the processing order in some cases.

In this card, we introduce two different processing orders, 
First-in-First-out and Last-in-First-out and its two corresponding 
linear data structures, Queue and Stack.

We go through the definition, implementation and built-in functions 
for each data structure. Then, we focus more on the practical 
applications of these two data structures.

By completing this card, you should be able to:

Understand the principle of the processing orders of FIFO and LIFO;
Implement these two data structures;
Be familiar with the built-in queue and stack structure;
Solve basic queue-related problems, especially BFS;
Solve basic stack-related problems;
Understand how system stack helps you when you solve problems using 
DFS and other recursion algorithms
